Feature: Functionality of previous collage picker on collage display page
The previous collage picker should show scaled down versions of previously created collages in the session. It will not show the collage currently displayed in the main collage space. When a collage in the previous collage picker is clicked, the full sized original image appears in the main collage space with its title. The collages should appear in a single horizontal row. If there isnâ€™t enough space, a scroll bar is there allow the user to see the entire row.
